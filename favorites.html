                            a day, besides weekends when he is sleeping till 12:00. Healthy food is always better then junk food, but it will never taste good as junk food, that's 
                            why it's hard for <b>Fatlum Maliqi</b> to eat healthier these days. "Sleep" is what everyone would choose, before anything, <b>Fatlum Maliqi</b> really 
                            loves waking up early but later, after he finishs work, he has to do, he likes to take a nap for like one to one half hour sleep. This nap is better then 
                            sleeping 12 hours at night. Something like this, that is worst is talking nap late at afternoon, if <b>Fatlum</b> takes a nap for like 3 hours before 
                            sleeping, this is the worst thing, after that nap he just gets stun for the whole night, and after he goes at bad for sleep he will be watching roof for 
                            like 2 hours cause he cannot sleep.</p>
