                    <p><b>Fatlum Maliqi</b> was born on 29 June 2002, in Kumanovo, Macedonia. Fatlum was named by his grandfather who passed away 7 years ago. <b>Fatlum</b> is the oldest  
                        child in his family, he has only a brother.<b>Fatlum</b> lived in <b>Kumanovo</b> for 6 years, where he made his first steps and said his first words, but later 
                        his family decided to move to <b>Ferizaj</b>, where his father got his new job. It has been 12 years since Maliqi family placed in <b>Ferizaj, Kosovo</b>. New city 
                        and new people really hitted <b>Fatlum</b> different, but after days <b>Fatum Maliqi</b> started making new friends, started school.<br> Every year, in summer holidays
                        Fatlum takes a break, when he spent about 2 weeks in <b>Kumanovo</b>, every one is there, started from kids to elderly men. That time  is the only time of the year,
                        when all of his family gets together. This time is golden for him. In <b>Kumanovo Fatlum's</b> home is a neighborhood full of Maliqi family, so it couldn't be better.
                        Staying late at nights with around you all your close family and sleeping late in morning, this is holiday.<br><b>Fatlum Maliqi</b> followed to courses in his life, 
                        its not enough but better then any. Im talking about language courses. He finished the course of english early in when he started primary school, he went in this 
                        course only for a level. <b>Fatlum</b> went to french course too, he followed this course in summer of 2020, he finished it for 3 months, and got the lv.A1 certificate.
                        Language is important for anyone, it opens doors everywhere. This was the main reason why <b>F.M.</b> followed the french course, he wanted to go to <b>Switzerland</b>,
                        at his uncle to work for him a few months, but this kind of wish killed the pandemic Covid-19.<br>One thing to add, is that <b>Fatlum Maliqi</b> followed a karate 
                        course too, he was good karate fighter, thats what his trainer told him. <b>Fatlum</b> was in this  sport when he was too young and such a kid, around age of 10. 
                        He trained for 2 years and half, all things were going good, he took part in tournaments. His first tournament was in Ferizaj, where he was in the first place, one 
                        after this one he placed first too. But something different happened in <b>Prizren</b> before this tournament he got an injure feet, what it didnt let him fight. This
                        was really disappointing for him. After <b>Prizren</b> tournament he quit his karate career for ever!</p>

                        <h3>Primary Education</h3>
                            <p>Primary school is the first stage of education, if u get the basics there to learn better, these things will follow you for life, for a better succes.
                                <b>Faltum Maliqi</b> used to go at <b>"Gjons Serreci"</b> as his primary sschool. <b>"Gjon Serreci"</b> was an old school, but the teachers there made
                                tter. <b>Fatlum</b> went to this school for 9 years, in this school he learned writing and reading. The first 5 years of primary school, were very 
                                kind, he such a good teacher named Merita Sejdiu, she teached him mother's language, math english etc.<br>At the last year with her teacher, the 
                                <b>Fatlum's</b> generation, all over <b>Kosovo</b> had a competition for the best project. <b>Fatlum Maliqi</b> and his class dessided to make a 
                                project for nature, agains environment pollution. They were too young for projects, but the teaming was next level. Everyone knows that team work 
                                makes the dream work, so it did at <b>Fatlum's</b> class, they won this competition, with that a check about 500â‚¬ to implement their project. As u 
                                read upper the project was for nature so they bout some cool baskets, they put some recycle sights, for each baskets, to contain for example only 
                                plastic, letter, metal or other. To end this stage of life, in <b>Kosovo</b> they organise a semi-prom night for the whole generate who finished
                                primary school.</p>

                            <h3>High School</h3>
                            <p>High school was really different then primary one, <b>Fatlum Maliqi</b> joined the <b>"Kuvendi i Arberit"</b> high school in 2017. There was an writing 
                                exam after primaryu school, if u couldn't pass it you couldn't join high school too. But <b>F.M.</b> hopefully passed it, im saying hopefully because 
                                it is such a silly exam, its so stressfull for students and it's so unfair for good students.<br> The first day of high school was very akward for
                                <b>Fatlum Maliqi</b>, every student was waiting for the director infront of school, when he showed up he started deviding us in classes. New faces,
                                new professors was such a challenge for <b>Fatlum Maliqi</b>. The first day went with watcing each others but later they all become good friends, 
                                it is known that the friendship you made in high school is golden, so was <b>Fatlum's</b> too. High school was only 3 years, these years went like 
                                three weeks, for these three <b>Fatlum</b> didn't focus at learning that munch, he just created memories that will follow him whole life. Just like 
                                the end of primary school, at the end of high school it was meaned to have a prom night, but this was just a wish of gradueters, because Pandemic 
                                Covid-19 ruined this event too. After hight school <b>Fatlum Maliqi</b> decided to continue bachelor education, at <b>Universum College</b> in the 
                                Computing Sience department</p>
